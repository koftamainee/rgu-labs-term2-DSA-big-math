# rgu-labs-term2-DSA-big-math

Tasks 1, 2, 3, 5 from 2 lab 2 term of RSU Kosygin.

## Contains several classes to work with high precision math computations
- ### bigint:
  storing integers, high efficency memory usage for numbers in normal int range, implemented arithmetics, logical, bitwise operations, IO.
- ### bigfloat:
  storing floating point numbers via fraction of 2 bigints. Implemented arithmetics, basic trigonometry, exponential and logarithmic functions, IO
- ### bigpolynomial (?):
  WIP
- ### bigcomplex (?):
  WIP
